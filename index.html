                    <h2>Why go back?</h2>
                    <p>While I have some more advanced concepts pretty well 
                        mastered, my thorough understanding of more basic 
                        web building technologies could use some work.</p>
                    <h2>The plan.</h2>
                    <p>This site is a practice project starting with simple 
                        HTML, CSS, and moving into Javascript. Once I feel much
                        more confident in these programming principles I will
                        move on to build interactive pages feeding a data 
                        server and serving greater purpose.
                    <h2>How things will go</h2>
                    <p>The more I hand type common elements and functions and memorize 
                        syntax, these will begin to flow naturally straight from my fingers 
                        to the World Wide Web. Once I have mastered these basic
                        concepts and pair them with larger data models there is nothing
                        that can stop me from achieving all of my grandiose dreams.</p>
