            <h1>Getting back to basics with HTML</h1>
            <h2>Why go back?</h2>
            <p>While I have some more advanced concepts pretty well 
                mastered, my thorough understanding of more basic 
                web building technologies could use some work.</p>
            <h2>The plan.</h2>
            <p>This site is a practice project starting with simple 
                HTML, CSS, and moving into Javascript. Once I feel much
                more confident in these programming principles I will
                move on to build interactive pages feeding a data 
                server and serving greater purpose.
            <h2>How things will go</h2>
            <p>The more I hand type common elements and functions and memorize 
                syntax, these will begin to flow naturally straight from my fingers 
                to the World Wide Web. Once I have mastered these basic
                concepts and pair them with larger data models there is nothing
                that can stop me from achieving all of my grandiose dreams.</p>
