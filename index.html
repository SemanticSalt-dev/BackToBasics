            <p>While I have some more advanced concepts pretty well 
                mastered, my thorough understanding of more basic 
                web building technologies could use some work.</p>
            <p>This site is a practice project starting with simple 
                HTML, CSS, and moving into Javascript. Once I feel much
                more confident in these programming principles I will
                move on to build interactive pages feeding a data 
                server and serving greater purpose.
            <p>The more I hand type common elements and functions I will
                better memorize syntax and these will flow naturally from
                my fingers to the World Wide Web. Once I have mastered basic
                concepts and pair them with larger data models there is nothing
                that can stop me from achieving all of my grandiose dreams.</p>
